0,about_src,"Welcome to Risaala \n\nThis application was first developed as a means of mass communication with Engineers in the field.\n\n
        It takes emails and turns them into SMSs to be sent out to a collection of numbers, usually clients or engineers with jobs.\n\n
By having one email address and many numbers on this application, one can better communicate a standard job to many engineers who are in the field.
\n\n
We have found that this application has many uses.\n\n
- a pizza parlour that may send its delivery personnel orders. It may also choose to send its customers their order confirmation. \n\n
- Sales office may send instructions to its sales team as to which client to see, when, and where.\n\n
- general information to its client list.\n\n
- a free SMS service for your social network. One email that will be forwarded instantaneously to your members without them having to check their emails.
\n\n\n
We will be introducing many more functions and safeguards to this application and we hope you enjoy it.\n
\n\n
None of the users information is stored online by the developer and we have a policy of respecting privacy for it is our first duty and promise to users.
